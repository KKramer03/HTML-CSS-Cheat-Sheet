            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to describe how the elements 
            made using HTML will display (color, size, location). CSS adds style to HTML's structure.

            <h2><u>Parts of CSS</u></h2>
            <p>All CSS is made using 3 basic parts. Selectors, declarations, and curly brackets.

        <div class="info">
            <h3><u>Selectors</u></h3> 
            <p>Selectors choose what elements you want stylized. They can be elements (p, h1, body),
                classes, id's, universal selectors, and child or descendant selectors. Classes are added
                to opening tags &lt;p class="example"&gt; and mean that any element with them will be selected.
                Id's are similar but they only apply to one element. &lt;p id="newexample"&gt;. In this case 
                only the &lt;p&gt; tag would be selected, other elements with the id would be ignored. Chid and descendant selectors are 
                simillar. Child selectors (div > p) will only select the element that is nested inside the first element.
                While descendant selectors (div p) will select any of the element inside the first element no matter how
                far nested it is. Multiple selectors can be used with commas (p, h1, h2). Element selectors don't use brackets.
            </p>

        <div class="info">
            <h3><u>Declarations</u></h3>
            <p>Declarations are the part of CSS that say what will change for the selectors. All declarations
                must be put inside of two {} curly brackets. The declaration has the property (background-color)
                followed by a colon (:). The value follows after that (blue). After that the declaration is 
                closed with a semi colon (;). You can have as many declarations in the brackets as you
                want as long as each is ended with a semi colon.

            <h2><u>Ways to use CSS</u></h2>
            <p>There are 3 ways to use CSS. External style sheets, internal style sheets, and
                inline style sheets.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info"> 
            <h3><u>External style sheets</u></h3>
            <p>External style sheets are seperate files that are linked to the document to be styled.
                The link tag must be used inside the &lt;head&gt; tag to link. It typically looks like this 
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;, rel defines the relationship of the two linked documents
                "stylesheet" and href is the link to the file itself "styles.css".
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <h3><u>Internal style sheets</u></h3>
            <p>Internal style sheets are those inside the document being styled itself. This can be done by inputting
                the CSS in the &lt;style&gt; tag inside of the &lt;head&gt; tag.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info"> 
            <h3><u>Inline style sheets</u></h3>
            <p>Inline style sheets are those that are inside the elements themselves. This way does not use
                curly braces or selectors, only declarations and properties wrapped in quotations. For example,
                &lt;p style="color:blue;"&gt; They are made using the style attribute in the opening tag.
                Multiple declarations can be made inside of the quotes as long as they end with a semi colon.

            <h2><u>CSS Layout</u></h2>
            <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/misc/boxmodel.png" alt="CSS Layout">
            <p>There are 4 main segments of an element in CSS.<br>
            Content - The actual text or image being displayed.<br>
            Padding - The empty space around the content.<br>
            Border - An invisible (or visible) border in between the padding and the margin <br>
            Margin - The empty space around and outside of the border<br>
